# RED RUST

## A key value memory storage Redis alternative built with Rust

üëÄ Hey there! So, I've been tinkering with something pretty neat lately called RedRust. It's essentially a fast alternative to Redis, it's all built using Rust.

Now, why did I decide to roll with RedRust? Well, just recently, Redis threw us all a curveball by switching up its license to this whole dual 'source-available' deal. Not exactly developer-friendly, especially for those of us in the commercial game. So, I thought, why not cook up a solution that's hassle-free for everyone?

Plus, I've been itching to really sink my teeth into Rust, you know? So, I figured, why not kill two birds with one stone? Thus, Radish was born!

Now, before you go tossing Radish into your production stack, a little heads-up - it's still in the oven, so to speak.

Not fully battle-tested yet. Currently still in development mode, would love to get your contributions though!!!
But hey, I've decided to pour everything I've got into making it rock-solid, even if it's just me flying solo on this project.

And here's the deal - all I'm asking for is a little ‚≠ê in return. Just a small token of appreciation
